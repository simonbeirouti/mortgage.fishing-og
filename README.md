# What is it

This is the README for mortgage.fishing. Why create this? I wanted to build a website that is a blog at heart and use this to attract new business to myself, and others in the finance space. At it's core, it's going to have high quality content for those looking for loans to consider.

## What I used to build it

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)

## How to monetize

I could do any of the following to monetise the website:

1. Run ads to other businesses in the mortgage broking space
2. Get paid by mortgage brokers for leads
3. Earn commision from the loan applications
